# crossplane-secret-sync

This roject contains a Helm chart allowing you to synchronize secrets from the [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) control plane into another cluster using the Crossplane [Helm provider](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-helm).

This serves as workaround for the lacking feature of patching from `Secrets` in Crossplane XRs.
See also issue [2772](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/issues/2772).
